# snake-golf

Obfuscated Snake Game.

All STL C++, runs in command window, no external libraries!

457 characters, include statements not included (stdio, chrono, thread, cstring, cstdlib)

Many things had corners cut to reduce characters. View commit history to see the code collapsing, and ways to 
change the code to accommodate the game for your needs if you would like.
